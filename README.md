# Conways-game-of-life

This is a code challenge of the book Four Rules of Simple Design. 

I'm on the path to learn better designs so I decided to make this challenge. It's intended to solve the "Conway's game of life" 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

I enjoy a lot while doing this kind of excercises so it's not intended to be professional, it's intended to make me happy and have fun while doing it. Some methods name doesn't have much sense because I was quite high while doing it but still makes its job. 

I will be upgrading the code, while reading the book, and looking up for better design and practices.
