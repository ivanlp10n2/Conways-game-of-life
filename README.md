# Conways-game-of-life

This is a code challenge of the book Four Rules of Simple Design. 

I'm on the path to learn better designs so I decided to make this challenge. It's intended to solve the "Conway's game of life"

Some methods name doesn't have much sense because I was quite high while coding but still makes its job. 
I will be upgrading the code, while reading the book, and looking up for better design and practices.
