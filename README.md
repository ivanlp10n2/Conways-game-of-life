# Conways-game-of-life

This is a code challenge of the book Four Rules of Simple Design. 

I'm on the path to learn better designs so I decided to make this challenge. It's intended to solve the "Conway's game of life"

Disclaimer: I was kinda drunk and high while doint it so it might be possible that some names were not the most appropiated.. but still makes its job.
